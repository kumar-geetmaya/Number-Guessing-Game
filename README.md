# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based Java application. The program generates a random number within a specified range, and the user attempts to guess the number. The game provides feedback for each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number with the least number of attempts.

This project demonstrates basic concepts in Java, such as random number generation, user input handling, and control flow.
